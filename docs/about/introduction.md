I'm Anebix.

I go by a few names, least commonly Ane, but mostly Neb, Bix, Nebby, Bixie, and the like. You can call me any of those if we're friends, although if we've just met, please ask! I'll probably let you use one of my shortnames anyway :P

My name has a bit of a complex history. Some things I'm not willing to divulge, but here's what I can tell you!

- My name starts with an A
- It's space themed, hence "neb" for nebula
- It has a VCVCVC (vowel consonant) pattern for easy nicknaming
- It's short enough to use regularly, but I enjoy shorter names like Bix just as well
- It's pronounced "An-eh-bicks" ([/ˈænəbɪks/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%C3%A6n%C9%99b%C9%AAks))
